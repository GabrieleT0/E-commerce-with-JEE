# E-commerce-with-JEE
Web application created during the university course of technologies and software for the web.
This is a small e-commerce that which allows you to view the catalog of products, add them to the cart and place an order. There is also a view for the site manager, where he can add new products, see registered users on the site, see the users orders, and change the status of an order (in progress-shipped-deleted).
